## Project 1: Bachelor Thesis - Asymptotic Normaility for Tesselation-based Betti Numbers

In this project, we explore the fascinating realm of topological data analysis (TDA), a powerful tool for unraveling the intricate structures within complex datasets. Our focus centers on persistent Betti numbers, a novel approach that offers a multi-scale perspective on topological changes.

**Objectives:**

- Explore the computation of persistent Betti numbers.
- Establish a central limit theorem for persistent Betti numbers for a general filtration satisfying some conditions. The conditions are, for example, met by the Cech filtration.
- Establish another central limit theorem for persistent Betti numbers for a Voronoi tessellation-adapted filtration.
